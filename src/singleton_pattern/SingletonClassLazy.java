 * 
 * @Usage 		- 	Utilize the Singleton Pattern when you need to ensure that only one object of that class should be created.
 * 					For an example, use this pattern in resources heavy object such as database connections. In here if you're not sure whether this singleton is gonna be used
 *
 * @Type 		- 	Lazy initialization.
